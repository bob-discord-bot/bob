# bob
bob is a plug-n-play Discord chat bot

## how to use
1. install the requirements
2. put token in `token.txt`
3. run main.py

## TODOs
- guild blacklist
- clean up the HTML clutter in /templates, arguably a React app would be great but im too tired to do it so if you want
  to then go ahead lmfao
- (optional) move from JSON files to a database, preferably SQLite
